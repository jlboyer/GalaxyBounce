# Galaxy Bounce

An adventure through the space powered by gravity and inertia....

Galaxy Bounce is a game built with HTML canvas and CSS animation overlays to create a simple, fun experience with a covert agenda to teach the importance of relative motion to players. 

The project was completed as the first major deliverable for the General Assembly Immersive Software Engineering program as way to encapsulate and reinforce the importance of Object Oriented Programming. Additionally, the use of canvas highlights the enumerable amount of calculations that are necessary every second, simply to provide the illusion of a rendered shape sitting still, let alone animated. That is, even static websites are far from static in the way we might be inclined to think of them. 

Below are the initial hand sketch and in-progress render during the debugging phase of the project. It should be noted this project was conceptualized, designed and completed to MVP level within 3 days.
